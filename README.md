This backend project made with php8.3 and symfony 7.0 (but used symfony 6.2 attributes I think).
I used doctrine orm 3.1 and doctrine migrations 3.3, mysql as database.

You can add titles, users and posts here. all crud operations are also available.

Relation is users can create posts by using titles. and on frontend you can see titles and posts that based on title.

I'll add routes later.
